This project provides experimental code for "Perceptual Averaging Does Not Compute a Single Mean but Summarizes a Distribution", by MyoungAh Kim and Sang Chul Chong. It is written in MATLAB and contains a psychophysics experiment in which participants report the mean size of a set of circles using a 'modified method-of-adjustment task'.
